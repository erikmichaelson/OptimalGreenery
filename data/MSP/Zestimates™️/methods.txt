1. Randomly select addresses from the Hennepin/ Ramsey API
2. Query the Zestimates API with that address
	a) if it's in Zillow, stitch it together with the address for the first variable!
		i. it still might not be residential, so we're going to have to clean it
		ii. find out how to do above

I guess this is it, we'll see once I start querying
