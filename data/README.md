Data
==============
The data is organized by city, since each city has a slightly different format.
Within each city folder there are python scripts (in progress) showing how the data was extracted and put together.
As this project progresses there this will be more cohesive, followed probably by a split into "raw" and "final" data folders for what I actually run through regressions.

here's my guess for what the data is going to look like ~once~ it's in Stata:
\[Address] \[price] \[tree cover val] \[distance from park] \[weighted distance from park] \[crime]##[parkDistance]
